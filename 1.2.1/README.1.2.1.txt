DXVK 1.2.1 for POE

This version requires manual enablement of DXVK_ASYNC configuration.

Non-steam client:

In the folders, there are 2 bat scripts which will start the game with required settings, use those to launch the game (they have to be in the same directory as game)

For Steam (not easily possible, I don't recommend using this version for steam client, you can still try, but without ASYNC the perfomance will be all over the place)
