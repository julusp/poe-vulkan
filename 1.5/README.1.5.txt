DXVK 1.5 for POE

This version has already async mode integrated, hence it is bit easier to use.

With enabled cache:
Just run the game as usual (icon on desktop, steam, whatever)


With disabled cache (not possible for steam at the moment):

Non-steam client:
In the folders, there is single bat script which will start the game with disabled cache, use it to launch the game (it has to be in the same directory as game)
